# Pads-project

Created purely in Python for a school individual project, using libraries such as Tkinter for Gui and SQLite3 for database.

The program has login functionality that also comes with registration, and password retrieval by keying in the email.
Users are separated in three types; admin, manager and staff, each with different capabilities with what they can do in the program.
